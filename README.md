# Get The Fit - Milestone Project #4


# Overview
An e-commerce site for users to browse gymwear and accessories. The site offers products from well known and established gymwear companies. Inspiration for this site was taken from existing 3rd party sites selling products made by high end brands, the only difference is that this site focusses on one demographic (being sports enthusiasts and gym members) rather than their sites product range which spans across general clothing sections such as jeans, tshirts, shirts and footwear which include both trainers and smart shoes.

# User Experience (UX)
![Am I Responsive?]()

## 1. First Time Visitor Goals
* I want to be able to browse through products with easy naviagtion, this includes the use of a search bar and product links.
* I would like to have the ability to register my details using a username and password.
## 2.  Returning Visitor Goals
* I would like to purchase products and check my order history
# Design
## 1. Colour Scheme
* The colour scheme for the design consists of blacks, yellows and blues (for free delivery suggestion text and shopping bag icon when products have been added - this actually came built in so I've decided to keep it as it goes well). The colour scheme is simple yet attractive to the user and doesn't overload their experice with too much noise. I like to call it simple but effective.

## 2. Typography
* Home Link & Page Titles - Montserrat. This font was chosen as the style goes well with a black background, an off-white colour was used to finish the look
* General Text - Almarai. I chose this font because it compliments the title and home logo text. This text also looks great when it's condensed down on mobile view and goes well in all product details and descriptions. An off-white color was also used. Both fonts used also have a defaul sans-serif text to fall back on incase of page issues.

## 3. Imagery
* The imagery for this is pretty straight forward, the home page consists of one image spanning the entire cover of the page. This was sourced for free from Artist Montsera @ [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
* Product Images were sourced from various companies, all of which can be found listed in the [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) file in this project.


# Technologies
## 1. Coding Languages
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## 2. Libararies, Frameworks & Additional Programmes
* [Font Awesome 4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/): The Font Awesome library was used throughout the design to add responsive and unresponsive icons for a positive user experience.
* [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/): The Bootstrap grid system was used for the layout as well as additional forms, responsiveness and website styling.
* [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/): I used the Microsoft Word programme to create my Rules & Regulations document which appears in a seperate window when the hyperlink is clicked.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Google Fonts was used to import the Abel Family & Open Sans Condensed font style throughout my design.
* [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/): Shutterstock was used for its array of useful media images that fit well within the design of the site.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): I used Balsamiq for my website frameworks.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/): GitHub was used to store all of my pushed code after completion to prevent loss through site crashes or otherwise.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): jQuery was installed to enable my NavBar toggler icon to become responsive when used in mobile format.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Git was used for version control and to make good use of my git pod terminal to push my code from Git to GitHub.

# Site Testing
## 1. Code Checking & Validation
* I validated all four pages of my HTML code using the [W3C HTML Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and my CSS code by using the [W3C CSS Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## 2. User Story Testing and Results
###  A - First Time Visitor Goals
* As a first time vistior I want to learn more about what makes this gym different from the many others out there, so I'm looking for incentives / promotional offers or otherwise.
* I want to navigate easily throughout the content.
* As a potential new gym member, I want to see testimonials / feedback from current members before I invest.

### B - Result
* Upon first entering the site, for a 24-hour independant gym you can see a lot of effort has gone into the design - this shows the owners attention to detail. This gives the end user a positive impression that the owners care about the business.
* The nav bar stands out due to the colour scheme which enables easy navigation, the first few scrolls bring the user to the member testimonial section which is both informative and inviting. 
* The layout of the site is spacious and simple, allowing the user to avoid being distacted by too much information.
* The membership discount promotional incentive is situated within an image which fits well within both the color scheme and design.
* The collaboration page can be easily found within the nav bar which brings the first-time user to the campaign page, this instantly makes the business unique as this is not something an end user would have come across before.

### A - Returning Visitor Goals
* I would like to be able to contact the gym incase I have any further questions or concerns.
* I would like to find out about any personal trainers available within the business and their contact details.
* I would like to know the location of the premises and the owner contact details in the event of joining up.

### B - Results
* The contact form is located within the about us page which is where I as an end user would expect the contact form to be.
* The gym has 3 personal trainers available with email addresses, their short story is really informative to me as an end user as I know what their principles and intentions are for their clients, rather than just a short introduction.
* The address and contact details are found together in one section.

### A - Frequent Visitor Goals
* I would like to check the site for any updates on the collaboration competition featured.
* I would like to see any upcoming personal appearances from Models/Fitness Influencers
* I would like to check if there are any changes to company policy and procedure regarding COVID-19 restrictions or otherwise.

### B - Results
* The collaboration information located on page 3 shows the updated deadline for submission at the bottom of the section.
* The page has a dedicated section for each PA (Personal Appearance) announced, I enjoyed how the section is laid out in regards to imagery and information. 
* A hyperlink is found inside the footer on each page which opens up a seperate browser window detailing the gyms policies and procedures, the colour scheme of that documentation matches the site which I found to tie in well.

## 3. Devices and Browsers
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome), [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) & [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) were the browsers used for desktop testing. All of which showed no performance issues. No new browser windows opened when links were clicked which is to be expected. 
* I used an old iPhone 5 to test my site using [Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) as well as a Samsung Galaxy A21s to test the site on a bigger screen. Both of which showed no distortion or stretched / pixelated imagery.

## 4. Third Party End User Testing
* I decided to test my site on a number of colleagues and family members which I advised to act as mutual parties for genuine feedback. Most found the site to be professional, the negative feedback I recieved was regarding the Trainer and Member images not sitting evenly between their name and paragraph text. This has since been rectified and further details are explained in the 'Bugs & Fixes' section.

## 5. Bugs & Fixes
1. NavBar links would not stay on another color when the active psuedo-class was introduced to my CSS file. This was rectified by removing the bg-dark and bg-light inline Bootstrap classes. Bootstrap had to be overidden.
2. NavBar color of black was removed when the inline bg-dark & bg-light inline classes were removed. This was resolved by creating a new CSS .navbar class and then styled with colour choice.
3. Media images and text for the Trainer and Member testimonial sections became disloged from their positioning when viewed on a mobile device. I removed the position:absolute from the .rounded-circle class and moved the images between the name header and the paragraph class and gave them a top and bottom margin to allow better positioning when viewed on a mobile device.
4. The jumbotron text on page 1 and 2 weren't centered within the image when moz, webkit & O prefixes were removed as I had sourced the hero image code from the Whisky Drop project. I had also accidentally removed the flex display, align item and justify content properties, which were restored. This then rectified the issue.
5. Could not change the border colour on the NavBar toggle icon to blue when clicked. The border colour surrounding the NavBar toggler icon was set to Bootstrap default yellow when active. This was rectified by removing the outline in the button:hover class to none via [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools). I was then able to add individual CSS styling for the navbar-toggler icon by adding the :focus and :hover psuedo classes.
6. On the sign up page of the site I've attempted to add an assistive technology attribute which I cannot get to become responsive when I hover over the link. Checked the example code on the [W3org Site](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA8) with no further action taken.

# Deployment
## Git Hub Pages
* To create this project and it's repository, I opened a new repository by clicking the green button "new", making sure I used the Code Institute's student template.
* Once this repository was created I then selected the Git Pod button to start work on my code.
* Once my code was created I then performed git add, git commit and git push via the terminal where it was then pushed to my repository. I then performed the following steps:
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository, locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under the Source title, click the dropdown button labelled "None" and select the "Master Branch" option (this will prompt the page to automatically refresh)
5. Scroll back down to the Git Hub Pages section to find the published site link.
* You can clone the repository via the command line by performing the following:
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click the button with the arrow icon labelled 'Code'.
