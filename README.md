# Get The Fit - Milestone Project #4


# Overview
An e-commerce site for users to browse gymwear and accessories. The site offers products from well known and established gymwear companies. Inspiration for this site was taken from existing 3rd party sites selling products made by high end brands, the only difference is that this site focusses on one demographic (being gymwear) rather than their sites product range which spans across general clothing sections such as jeans, tshirts, shirts and footwear which include both trainers and smart shoes.
